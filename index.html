	  <br /><br />
      <p class="lead"> ViCSBI is a research and training initiative dedicated to promote and to facilitate new collaborations among investigators of species interactions in California. The nexus of our work comprises the creation and use of a novel database that will
be available to researchers worldwide.  The vision for the design of ViCSBI has been generated by investigators at four UC campuses (UC
		  <img src="images/vos.jpg" alt="" style="float:right;width:400px">
 Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley, UC Riverside, and UC Davis), including faculty and research scientists at a range of career stages in ecology and evolution, natural history collection data scientists at UC’s museums and herbaria, and agricultural extension researchers. 
<br /><br />
Our expertise comprises plant and insect ecology, evolution, and phylogenetics; climate change research; data science and modeling; student and postdoctoral mentoring; and public outreach. Some of us have collaborated before, but our priority is to recruit 
early-career UC faculty, postdoctoral associates and research staff, and to initiate new collaborative, long-term research teams.  UC Santa Barbara will be the hub for the assembly and integration of ViCSBI’s database, which will unite and integrate specimen-based records, and for the development of data science training tools. UC Berkeley will play a major collaborative role in database design and implementation, and the integration of phylogenetic data.  UC Riverside and UC Davis will provide significant support for the oversight of invertebrate data, for the identification of interactions between plant and insect taxa, and for providing bridges between basic research in ecology and evolution and applied research in agriculture. </p>

          <h1 class="display-6">Enhancing UC’s research capacity in the study of specimen- and observation-based species interactions: </h1>
    	  <br /><br />
<p class="lead">To propel and to accelerate climate change research, researchers need an integrated, unified, quality-controlled, research-ready database that enables the detection of the effects of environmental change on ecologically and agriculturally critical biotic interactions.  Until we have a clear understanding of the effects of climate change and land-use modifications on beneficial and antagonistic biotic interactions, we can neither mitigate prospective negative effects nor identify agricultural or natural systems that may be buffered against them.  ViCSBI’s creation of a fully integrated and easy-to-use database is a necessary step to enable the achievement of these goals, which are particularly vital in California due to its role as both a hotspot for biodiversity and as a key area of food production, both of which are threatened by ongoing and upcoming environmental change.  
    <br /><br />
    UC campus-based herbaria and museums house millions of plant, insect, bird, and mammal specimens.  These collections — and the faculty, postdocs, and students who use them for research and instruction — are renowned for their contributions to the fields of ecology, evolution, biodiversity, and systematics.  Across the UC system, natural history museums and herbaria have a rich history of collections-based and observational research; the development of novel approaches to Data Science, including the digitization of millions of specimens; formal and informal undergraduate and graduate training; and integrated field and laboratory research, revealing ecological patterns and processes that influence the persistence of wild and agricultural species and ecosystems.  These collections provide a vital bridge between basic and applied research in genetics, climate change science, ecology, evolution, and agriculture.
    <br /><br />
    Every UC herbarium and museum now uses state-of-the art, standardized methods and database software to provide specimen-based, electronic data and images that are freely accessible to scientists all over the world.  For example, the Consortium for California Herbaria (designed and curated at UC Berkeley) hosts millions of digitized, georeferenced herbarium specimens collected throughout California since 1800. There is, however, little formal integration of collections-based research across UC campuses or among disciplines (including phylogenetics, ecology, evolution, and climate change research), and there is no single database that facilitates the joint analysis of both botanical and entomological specimens.  As a result, the capacity for UC’s specimens to be used efficiently and to their fullest potential is limited.
    <br /><br />
    Perhaps the most important constraint to rapid research on species interactions is that most of the specimen-based data held in UC natural history collections are accessible on a variety of disparate on-line platforms but not in an integrated database that facilitates quantitative, multivariate analysis of the influence of changing environments on ecologically and agriculturally critical biotic interactions.  We believe that the time is right to leverage the boundless capacity of UC-based natural history collections to detect and to predict the effects of environmental change on biotic interactions, and we are dedicated to training the next generation of researchers to unlock this potential. In particular, our mission is to merge the fields of data science, bioinformatics, specimen curation, and ecology in a way that parallels the links that have been made between data science and genomics.
    <br /><br />
In sum, ViCSBI will increase UC’s research capacity by creating the first on-line, California-wide database that integrates specimen-based data (e.g., the date and location of each specimen’s collection) in a phylogenetic framework with historical, contemporary, and prospective future climate and land-use data. This database will also provide a repository of species-specific models capable of predicting the phenology and likely spatial distribution of thousands of taxa of plants, pollinator, and herbivores throughout California.  As new population genomic data become available for each species, these data can be used to predict the response to natural selection imposed by climate change, in the context of both range and phenological shifts.  The pillars of ViCSBI’s mission are:
<br />
(1) The creation of a novel database that targets inter-dependent species and higher taxa; 
<br />
(2) Engagement in novel research, including the effects of climate change and environmental alteration on pairs and networks of interacting species, including plant-pollinator, plant-herbivore, and native vs. exotic plants; and 
<br />
(3) The development of Data Science training resources (including virtual and in-person workshops and on-line research tools) that we will extend to investigators, postdocs, and students at every UC campus and California-based biological research institution (including the California Academy of Sciences, National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Agricultural Extension). 
<br /><br />
A primary goal is to facilitate the development of new collaborative teams engaged in research comprising the study of climate change, digitized natural history collections and observational data, and species interactions in wild and agricultural ecosystems, leading to new opportunities to seek significant research funding from the National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of the Environment, and private foundations.

<h1 class="display-6">Commitment to undergraduate and postgraduate education and training:  </h1>
<p class="lead">ViCSBI investigators have strong records of recruiting undergraduates from a diverse set of backgrounds to participate in research while earning lower and upper division credit in their majors.  We regularly recruit students through minority-serving organizations, including the California Alliance for Minority Participation, Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hipanics and Native Americans in Science, and UC Leadership Excellence through Advanced DegreeS (UCLEADS).  In addition, ViCSBI will develop free Data Science training courses (including virtual and in-person workshops in data acquisition and management, statistical modeling, species distribution models, and on-line research tools) that will be extended to undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs at every UC campus and California-based biological research institution (e.g., the California Academy of Sciences, National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service & Agricultural Extension).
<a id="outreach"></a>
</p>
<br /><br />

<h1 class="display-6">Opportunities for public engagement and community-building:</h1>
<p class="lead">ViCSBI will provide two primary opportunities for public engagement, both of which will raise awareness of UC’s important role in conservation and natural history.  First, portions of ViCSBI’s database assembly can be accelerated and improved by public participation, including the identification of GPS coordinates of museum and herbarium specimens from which this information is missing; updating the scientific names of species; identifying well-documented species interactions from specimen records and on-line observational data resources; and recording the flowering status of individual plant specimens. This work can be done remotely by participants trained via on-line courses, so potential COVID-related restrictions will not impede it.
		  <br /><br /> 
		  Second, we will continue to collaborate with ongoing efforts to recruit the public in on-line, specimen-based data collection.  PI Mazer has worked closely with the crowd-sourcing portal, Zooniverse, to create Herbarium Expeditions on its “Notes from Nature” platform (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/md68135/notes-from-nature-capturing-californias-flowers ), an activity that we will extend.   This platform provides easy-to-follow, highly visual tools with which to record data from museum specimens in a highly reproducible manner.  
		  <br /><br /> 
		  The proposed project will also facilitate the development of new collaborative teams engaged in research comprising the study of climate change, digitized natural history collections and observational data, and species interactions in wild and agricultural ecosystems, leading to new opportunities to seek significant research funding from the National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of the Environment, and private foundations.
